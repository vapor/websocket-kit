# ``WebsocketKit``

WebSocketKit provides an abstraction over [SwiftNIO's Websockets](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio.git) to make it easy to build websocket clients and servers in Swift.

## Overview

WebSocketKit provides functionality to send and receive data, ping/pongs and text, connection handling and upgrade handling. It should be simpler to use than using SwiftNIO directly.
